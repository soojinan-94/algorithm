> 문제 설명

```

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) { 
    let min = prices[0];
    let max_profit = 0;

    for(let i=0; i<prices.length-1; i++){
        if (prices[i] > prices[i+1]) {
            min = Math.min(min, prices[i+1])
        } else {
            prices[i] = min
        }
        if (prices[i+1] - min > 0) {
            max_profit = Math.max(max_profit, prices[i+1] - min);
        }
    }
};

시간복잡도와 메모리를 항상 생각하며 코드를 짜야겠다고 생각이들었다.
